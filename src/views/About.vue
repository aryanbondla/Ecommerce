              <p class="mb-4 p- 4">
                Founded in 2020, SnackHub began as a small family business with a simple vision:
                to provide people with healthy, delicious snacking options that they could feel good about eating.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4 p- 4">
                We noticed that most evening snacks were either unhealthy or boring. That's when we decided
                to curate a collection of premium nuts, dried fruits, organic treats, and gourmet snacks
                that combine nutrition with incredible taste.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to serve thousands of customers who trust us to deliver quality snacks
                right to their doorstep. Every product we offer is carefully selected and tested to ensure
                it meets our high standards for taste, nutrition, and quality.
